# Final-Project-jhenry3-fjbrenna

### Contributers
Joe Brennan and Julian Henry

### Summary
Trial runner: a game where you can create and name your avatar and run on the trail, jumping over obstacles on your way to a new high-score.
### Concepts and Modules
The game's interface uses the graphics from module 4 and we used polymorphism and inheritance concepts from module 2 as well as input validation.

### Operating Systems Tested
Mac

### Required Installations
None

### Citations for Outside Code
Shape, Rect, and Circle from class

### Grade
We believe that our program deserves a 120/140. In terms of design we completely forgot to make a testing function until it was too late.
And so we think that deserves a 5 point subtraction. As well as in terms of complexity we think that we didn't quite make it complex enough for a final project.
